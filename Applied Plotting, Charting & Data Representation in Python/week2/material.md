## Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures
Rougier et al. share their[ ten simple rules](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting/supplement/oNy2r/ten-simple-rules-for-better-figures) for drawing better figures, and use matplotlib to provide illustrative examples. As you read this paper, reflect on what you learned in the first module of the course -- principles from Tufte and Cairo -- and consider how you might realize these using matplotlib.
